# E06a-Particles-and-Screen-Shake

As with other exercises, Fork and Clone this repository.

This exercise is an opportunity to experiment with the Particles2D node in Godot and to give you a script with which you can implement screen shake.

This project contains three Particle2D nodes. Use them to implement any three of the following effects:  fire, smoke, rain, explosion, plasma, floating feathers, lightning, electric shocks, muzzle flash, fireball, snowflakes, fog, clouds, magic spell

I have linked to tutorials in the modules on Canvas; hopefully, those will be useful as you implement this exercise. Also, I have provided a variety of textures (from kenney.nl and rigzsoft.co.uk) that should help.

Part 2: The Camera node has an attached script which implements screen shake. Add WASD inputs to the project, and in the World script, trigger and add screen shake (add_trauma(some value)) to the Camera node when the user presses one of those keys.

When you have completed the exercise, *update the LICENSE and README.md*, commit and push your changes to GitHub, and turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.
